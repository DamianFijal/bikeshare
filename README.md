# **Explore US Bikeshare data using Python**
In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington. There is a Python code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### _Description_
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

In this project, I used data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. I've compared the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

### Files used
In this project, I've used files with data in csv format. 

chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
Washington.csv
